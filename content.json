TBI model (Surgical procedures) Written by Xingxing LiAnimals for TBI were bred for adaption for 3 days, and then the model was performed according to the procedures as below. Briefly, the mouse was anaesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate sodium and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus. A circular craniectomy, 2 mm in diameter, was performed with a dental drill on the left cranium: anterior/posterior, 0 mm; medial/lateral, +1.0 mm. The exposed site was hit by a weight of 20 g falling freely from 20 cm high. Hemostasis was confirmed before the skin were closed with resorbable 4/0 Ethicon stitches. Rats were then housed in individual cages to recover.
